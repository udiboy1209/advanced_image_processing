The algorithm we have implemented generates a CS matrix with arbitrary real values.
There are multiple problems in the realisation of such a CS matrix

\begin{enumerated}
    \item{It is difficult to assign different magnitude of weights to each pixel.
          The accuracy of the hardware will limit the real values to a few quantized 
          levels and hence we will have to use a matrix which performs worse but
          which can be created by the hardware.

        In Hitomi camera, the CS matrix contained only 0s and 1s hence the 
          hardware was a simple cardboard sheet with each pixel having a
          hole(representating 1s) or no hole(representing 0s).
          In our case, we will have to make holes with varying diameters to
          assign different weight to each pixel. These diameters can be created only
          to a certain degree of accuracy and hence we will have to reduce our
          matrix to that accuracy. The error in these diameters will also be higher
          than for a simple CS matrix with 1s and 0s.}


    \item{The CS matrix we have created will require some way to capture negative
    wieghted pixels also. This will require creating a separate hardware matrix
    for positive  and negative values and capturing two compressed measurements
    and subtracting them (The subtraction can be done either before measurement,
    which doubles the amount of hardware used, or can be done after measurement
    in software, which doubles the number of measurements hence reduces
    compression of the setup).}
